.. error::

 "Error in derepFastq(fls[[i]], qualityType = qualityType) : Not all provided files exist. Calls: learnErrors -> derepFastq. Execution halted"

|learnErrors| 

**Possible reason**: Some samples have completely discarded by quality filtering process. 

**Fix**: Edit the quality filtering settings or excluded poor quality samples prior ASVs workflow.

.. error::

 "Error in dimnames(x) <- dn : length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent"

|dimnames|

**Possible reason**: Using only one or two samples to generate ASVs table.

**Fix**: Include at least three samples to ASVs workflow to generate ASVs table. Note: fixing this error in the upcoming releases.
